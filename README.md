# OCI_SERVICES_EDL
A reformat of OCI Oracle Service Network IPs in EDL format so it can be used in Palo Alto Firewalls or others.

This is a simple JS srcipt to convert the Official Public List of OCI Services in JSON format (https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/tools/public_ip_ranges.json) to EDL format for all regions and services.

There's a HTML version that works without a server on the client side and a PHP version when your EDL client can't use client side JS.
